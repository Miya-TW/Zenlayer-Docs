# Case Study

Here are three examples of how Zenlayer customers are using ZGA to accelerate global application performance.

**Challenge**: Digital blockchain-based trading is much different from traditional stock and bond trading. The market operates around the clock, and transactions take place in real-time over the internet.Network speed can make or break a transaction, which is why buyers and sellers are very picky when choosing an exchange.&#x20;

At first, the customer's exchange website was mainly for domestic users. But over time, buyers and sellers from other regions started to register as users. The high-latency network made it difficult for users in these regions to complete a transaction successfully.

**Solution**: By using ZGA, the delay for users to access the exchange was reduced to less than 20ms. As a result, the website is now receiving better reviews and attracting more users.
