# Overview

Most global organizations are relying on the public internet for cross-border content sharing and application delivery. Yet, the public internet is slow, insecure, and unreliable. ZGA serves as a fast lane for global connectivity, as an alternative to the public internet.

Most companies offering network acceleration today provide middle mile acceleration between two PoPs. ZGA goes a step beyond, providing intelligent end-to-end acceleration, across the first, middle, and last mile for a much more comprehensive level of support.

**First Mile**: Zenlayer provides cloud direct connections to the public cloud.

**Middle Mile**: ZGA uses the Zenlayer software defined networking (SDN) backbone and protocol optimization for lightning-fast acceleration between PoP sites.

**Last Mile**: ZGA detects the userâ€™s access area using smart DNS and provides access to the nearest local ZGA PoP.
