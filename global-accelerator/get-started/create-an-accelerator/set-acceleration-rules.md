# Set Acceleration Rules

Tell us the protocol and port used by your service so that ZGA can forward user requests correctly:

**HTTP and HTTPS**: The default ports are 80 and 443 (can be modified); if you choose HTTPS, you will need to upload the necessary key and certification.\
**TCP and UDP**: The default ports are 80 and 53 (can be modified).\
If you selected IP Address in step **1**. above as the user access method, only TCP and UDP will be available here.
