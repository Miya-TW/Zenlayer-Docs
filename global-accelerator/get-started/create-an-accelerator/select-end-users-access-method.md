# Select End Users' Access Method

Select the method end users access your service from the two options shown:

* **Domain Name**: If your end users access your service via a domain name, (i.e., [www.zenlayer.com](http://www.zenlayer.com/)), please click on this button and enter the domain name in the field below.
* **IP Address**: If you want to accelerate a specific IP address or set of addresses, please make your selection(s) here.&#x20;

_\*If you are not sure whether you should select Domain Name or IP, please consult your operations personnel._

Regardless of your selection above, we will provide you with the IP and CNAME of your ZGA (Zenlayer Global Accelerator) upon successful completion of your deployment. See [Manage Accelerator](../manage-accelerators.md).

* **Domain name**: Please be sure to add the CNAME to your DNS record. See [Add DNS Record](../add-dns-record.md)
* **IP Address**: Directly use the IP address provided by ZGA for user access
