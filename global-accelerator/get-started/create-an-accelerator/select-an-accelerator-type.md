# Select an Accelerator Type

## Standard&#x20;

Provide an anycasted IP that can be assigned to multiple endpoints distributed across the world. IP anycast reduces latency and increases redundancy. The standard accelerator occupies only one acceleration IP.

Select the Custom Routing accelerator if you want to accelerate regions in China.

## Custom Routing&#x20;

Map a CNAME to a specified IP through DNS that can be assigned to each endpoint in the acceleration region. Custom Routing accelerator supports CN2 Direct China Connection route, and occupies one acceleration IP in each acceleration region.

Select all the regions you want to accelerate. An acceleration line will be generated between your selected origin and each acceleration region.
