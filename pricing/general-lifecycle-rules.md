<mark style="color:orange;">The duration of each period is subject to different services. Please refer to specific product pricing documentation for details.</mark>
{% endhint %}

### **Subscription** -> **Expiration**

For pre-paid subscription service, you need to subscribe the service first by month. You can choose different subscription cycles according to your needs.\
When the service is about to expire, if your balance is not enough for renewal, the system will send reminder emails to the members with Administrator or Finance Access on the 7th day, 48 hours and 24 hours before expiration.

### **Balance Refill** -> **Deduction**

For post-paid service, you need to [refill your zenPoint balance](../platform/billing-center/refill-balance.md) first to ensure that the account has purchasing power. After you purchase the service, the system generates bills and perform deductions.

### **Protection Stage**

During the protection period, your service runs normally. The system will send reminder emails to the members with Administrator or Finance Access until you refill your balance. If you haven't refill in time, your service will be suspended.
