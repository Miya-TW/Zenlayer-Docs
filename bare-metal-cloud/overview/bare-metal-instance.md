# Bare Metal Instance

## **What is a bare metal cloud?**

Bare metal cloud (BMC) is a subset of the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud services bucket. It is essentially a service that incorporates dedicated server hardware along with the data center networking, storage, and facility. \
\
Zenlayer BMC provides customers with isolation, visibility, and control with a dedicated server. A bare metal instance looks like a classical instance (usually using virtualization) by providing customer a physical server fully dedicated to customer usage.\
\
Bare metal instances are physical servers. Each instance offered for rental is a distinct physical piece of hardware that is a functional server on its own. They are not virtual instance running in multiple pieces of shared hardware.
