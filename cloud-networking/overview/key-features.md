# Key Features

## **Global Connectivity**

Zenlayer's 220+ edge POPs are close to data centers in key markets, including emerging economies in China, India, Southeast Asia, South America, and the Middle East. Zenlayer also connects to leading cloud services like AWS, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud, Tencent Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and IBM Cloud.

## **Ultra-Low Latency**

Zenlayer strategically avoids public internet congestion, offering instant and on-demand networking while reducing latency by 30-80% during peak periods. In addition, all routes come with full redundancy, failover protection, and high availability with a 99.99% SLA.

## **Full-Mesh Networks**

Every node or POP can be interconnected within Zenlayer's high performance, full-mesh Layer 3 networks. These connections make the network highly flexible when routing data to reduce latency and costs while improving data transmission rates.

## **Segment Routing Technology**

Zenlayerâ€™s global backbone network consists of 60+ POPs with segment routing technology. Segment routing provides operator-level availability, enhanced operational efficiency, and guaranteed bandwidth for customers over a flexible interface.

## **Greater Agility**

Customers with office server addresses outside of a Zenlayer POP will not need to deploy a local loop. Zenlayer provides instant last mile access for small bandwidth customers through virtual edge for quick and low-cost access.
