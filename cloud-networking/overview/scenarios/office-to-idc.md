* For a Layer 2 network connection\
  Establish a local loop from your office to the equipment port in our SDN POP, and then establish cross connect from your data center to the equipment port in our SDN POP.\
  You will need to define the bandwidth cap of your connection.\

* For a Layer 3 network connection\
  Create an IPsec tunnel from your office to a virtual edge, and then establish cross connect from your data center to the equipment port in our SDN POP.\
  You will need to define the access bandwidth cap of each access point.
