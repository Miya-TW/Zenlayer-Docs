# Create a Layer 2 Connection

After creating a private connect, you can contact Zenlayer support or your data center operator to establish a cross connect.



## Procedures

### **Step 1 - Sign in and go to create**

1. Use your email address and password to sign in to [**zenConsole**](https://console.zenlayer.com/).
2. On the left navigation panel, go to **Cloud Networking** > **Private Connect** > **Create Data Center Interconnect**.



### **Step 2 - Configure the Source and Destination Ports**

#### 1. Select a source port closest to your one of your data centers.

**Existing Port**\
****If you have an established cross connect to Zenlayer Cloud Networking, you can select your existing port.&#x20;

**New Port**\
****If this is your first time creating a private connect, you will need to select a new port.

1\) Select the port location closest to one of your data centers.\
\
2\) Select the port rate. 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps are supported.\

\
3\) Label your port for identification.\
\
4\) Enter the legal business name of the authorized party. You will receive an LOA (letter of authorization) that is used to establish your cross connect.

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Icon.svg" alt="" data-size="line"><mark style="color:blue;">**Note**</mark>

* <mark style="color:blue;">The LOA will be emailed to you as an attachment 2 to 3 days after you submit your new port order. You can also download your LOA in the</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">**Port View**</mark> <mark style="color:blue;"></mark><mark style="color:blue;">on zenConsole.</mark>
* <mark style="color:blue;">The LOA will expire in 30 days. Please establish your cross connect as soon as possible.</mark>



#### 2. Select a destination port closest to the other data center.

The steps are the same as selecting a source port above.\


<mark style="color:blue;">****</mark><img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/Icon.svg" alt="" data-size="line"><mark style="color:blue;">**Note**</mark>\ <mark style="color:blue;">The lowest port rate of your source port and destination port determines the transmission rate of your private connection.</mark>



### **Step 3 - Configure the Connection**

Configure the connection between the source port and the destination port.

1. Select or enter the VLAN ID of your source and destination ports. Data will be transmitted in the corresponding VLAN.
2. Select the bandwidth cap of your private connect from 1 Mbps to 500 Mbps.
3. Label your private connect for identification.



### **Step 4 - Confirm Your Configuration**

1. Confirm the billing details and read through the policy.
2. Click **Create** to deploy your private connect.



## **Result**

After your cross connect is established, the corresponding port state will change to **Active** and you will receive a notification email. Once both source and destination ports are active, your private connect state will become **Active**.\

1. <mark style="color:blue;">Billing for private connect will not start until both source and destination ports are active, and your connection is active.</mark>
2. <mark style="color:blue;">Billing for your port will start:</mark>
   * <mark style="color:blue;">when the port is active.</mark>
   * <mark style="color:blue;">15 days after you submit the order â€“ whether or not your cross connect has been established.</mark>
