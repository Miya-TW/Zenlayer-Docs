### Step 4 - Select an instance to apply the security group to



### Step 5 - _<mark style="color:green;">(Optional)</mark>_ describe the security group



### Step 6 - Click _**Create**_ to create a security group



### Step 7 - Manage security groups

* Deploy the security group\
  On the security group interface, click the instances deployed the security group on to change or add the instance.\

* Edit the security group\
  On the security group interface, click **Edit** to change inbound and outbound rules.\

* Delete the security group\
  On the security group interface, click **Delete** to delete the security group then the instance will not be controlled by the rules.
